# TicTacToe
AP CSA
The following program was built in codeHS - an interactive website, helpful to refresh coding skills. This program constructs a TicTacToe game. 

Here's a little bit of detailed explanation about the code (Instructions):

In the TicTacToeTester class, use the methods that you created in the TicTacToe class to implement your own version of Tic Tac Toe.

Your game should take user input to determine which index the user would like to place their X’s and O’s, and check to see if there is a winner after every turn that is taken. If the user inputs an invalid space, they should be notified, and asked to input another index. Utilize loops to implement this effectively!

Your game should indicate which player won, and notify the users if there is a tie at the end.

Take advantage of all the methods that you created in the previous exercise, and feel free to make alterations to the game to make it your own!
